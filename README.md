# Dunder Mifflin SQL Project

This repository contains SQL scripts for a project simulating data analysis at the Dunder Mifflin corporate office, including two branches: Scranton and Stamford.

## Project Structure

- `sql_scripts/`
  - `tables.sql`: SQL script to create tables for employees, branches, products, and sales.
  - `insert_data.sql`: SQL script to insert sample data into the tables.
  - `corporate_questions.sql`: SQL script answering various business questions using the provided data.

## Overview

In this project, I played the role of a data analyst tasked with:
- Creating and managing database tables.
- Inserting and updating data.
- Performing data analysis to generate reports and insights.

## SQL Techniques Used

- **Basic Queries:** Data retrieval and filtering.
- **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries:** Filtering and aggregating data.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Simplifying complex queries.
- **Window Functions:** Analyzing data trends.
- **Views:** Creating reusable query results.
- **Data Manipulation:** Inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- **Schema Modification:** Altering table structures.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Run `tables.sql` to set up the database schema.
2. Execute `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.
3. Use `corporate_questions.sql` to run various queries and view the results.
